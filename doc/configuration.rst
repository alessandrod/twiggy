Configuring Output

.. currentmodule:: twiggy

This part discusses how to configure twiggy's output of messages.  You should do this once, near the start of your application's ``__main__``.

*******************
Quick Setup
*******************
To quickly configure output, use the `quick_setup` function.  Quick setup is limited to sending all messages to a file or ``sys.stderr``.  A timestamp will be prefixed when logging to a file.

.. autofunction:: quick_setup
    :noindex:

.. _twiggy-setup:

*******************
twiggy_setup.py
*******************
.. testsetup:: twiggy-setup

    from twiggy import emitters
    emitters.clear()

Twiggy's output side features modern, loosely coupled design.

By convention, your configuration lives in a file in your application called ``twiggy_setup.py``, in a function called ``twiggy_setup()``. You can of course put your configuration elsewhere, but using a separate module makes integration with configuration management systems easy.  You should import and run ``twiggy_setup`` near the top of your application.  It's particularly important to set up Twiggy *before spawning new processes*.

A ``twiggy_setup`` function should create ouputs and use the :func:`add_emitters` convenience function to link those outputs to the :data:`log`.

.. testcode:: twiggy-setup

    from twiggy import add_emitters, outputs, levels, filters, formats, emitters # import * is also ok
    def twiggy_setup():
        alice_output = outputs.FileOutput("alice.log", format=formats.line_format)
        bob_output = outputs.FileOutput("bob.log", format=formats.line_format)

        add_emitters(
            # (name, min_level, filter, output),
            ("alice", levels.DEBUG, None, alice_output),
            ("betty", levels.INFO, filters.names("betty"), bob_output),
            ("brian.*", levels.DEBUG, filters.glob_names("brian.*"), bob_output),
            )

    # near the top of your __main__
    twiggy_setup()

:func:`add_emitters` populates the :data:`emitters` dictionary:

.. doctest:: twiggy-setup

    >>> sorted(emitters.keys())
    ['alice', 'betty', 'brian.*']

In this example, we create two log destinations: ``alice.log`` and ``bob.log``.  alice will recieve all messages, and bob will receive two sets of messages:

* messages with the name field equal to ``betty`` and level >= ``INFO``
* messages with the name field glob-matching ``brian.*``

:class:`Emitters <.Emitter>` can be removed by deleting them from this dict. :attr:`~.Emitter.filter` and :attr:`~.Emitter.min_level` may be modified during the running of the application, but outputs *cannot* be changed.  Instead, remove the emitter and re-add it.

.. doctest:: twiggy-setup

    >>> # bump level
    ... emitters['alice'].min_level = levels.WARNING
    >>> # change filter
    ... emitters['alice'].filter = filters.names('alice', 'andy')
    >>> # remove entirely
    ... del emitters['alice']

We'll examine the various parts in more detail.

**************************
Outputs
**************************
Outputs are the destinations to which log messages are written (files, databases, etc.). Several :mod:`implementations <.outputs>` are provided. Once created, outputs cannot be modified.  Each output has an associated :mod:`format <.formats>`.

.. _async-logging:

Asynchronous Logging
====================
Many outputs can be configured to use a separate, dedicated process to log messages. This is known as :term:`asynchronous logging` and is enabled with the `msg_buffer <.AsyncOutput>` argument. Asynchronous mode dramatically reduces the cost of logging, as expensive formatting and writing operations are moved out of the main thread of control.

.. warning: There is a slight, but non-zero, chance that messages may be lost if something goes awry with the child process.

*********************
Formats
*********************
:mod:`Formats <.formats>` transform a log message into a form that can be written by an output. The result of formatting is output dependent; for example, an output that posts to an HTTP server may take a format that provides JSON, whereas an output that writes to a file may produce text.

Line-oriented formatting
========================
:class:`.LineFormat` formats messages for text-oriented outputs such as a file or standard error. It uses a `.ConversionTable` to stringify the arbitrary fields in a message. To customize, copy the default :data:`.line_format` and modify:

.. testsetup:: line-format
    
    from twiggy import *
    emitters.clear()

.. testcode:: line-format

    # in your twiggy_setup
    import copy
    my_format = copy.copy(formats.line_format)
    my_format.conversion.add(key = 'address', # name of the field
                             convert_value = hex, # gets original value
                             convert_item = "{0}={1}".format, # gets called with: key, converted_value
                             required = True)

    # output messages with name 'memory' to stderr
    add_emitters(('memory', levels.DEBUG, filters.names('memory'), outputs.StreamOutput(format = my_format)))

***************************
Filtering Output
***************************
The messages output by an emitter are determined by its :attr:`~.Emitter.min_level` and filter (a :func:`function <.filter>` which take a :class:`.Message` and returns bool). These attributes may be changed while the application is running. The :attr:`~.Emitter.filter` attribute of emitters is `intelligent <.msg_filter>`; you may assign strings, bools or functions and it will magically do the right thing.  Assigning a list indicates that *all* of the filters must pass for the message to be output.

.. testcode:: line-format

    e = emitters['memory']
    e.min_level = levels.WARNING
    # True allows all messages through (None works as well)
    e.filter = True
    # False blocks all messages
    e.filter = False
    # Strings are interpreted as regexes (regex objects ok too)
    e.filter = "^mem.*y$"
    # functions are passed the message; return True to emit
    e.filter = lambda msg: msg.fields['address'] > 0xDECAF
    # lists are all()'d
    e.filter = ["^mem.y$", lambda msg: msg.fields['address'] > 0xDECAF]
